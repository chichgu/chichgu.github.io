*“Those who do not move, do not notice their chains”*
 - Rosa Luxemburg

A few centuries back we rejected slavery and acknowledged that there is no lesser human beings. Today we come to acknowledge that there is no lesser human souls. Everyone should be able to express their soul and be whole, regardless of what they are called to do. People are of equal value, not only physically, but also spiritually.

And in the same way that abolishing slavery changed economy, society and organizations, abolishing corporate slavery will affect organizations, society and economy.

## Slavery 

(source: [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery))

Slavery is a system under which:

+ people are treated as property. 
+ Often slaves can be bought and sold. 

Slaves can be held from the time of their capture, purchase or birth, and deprived of the right:

+ to leave,
+ to refuse to work,
+ or to demand compensation. 

## Corporate slavery

Corporate slavery is a system under which:

+ people are treated as resource. 
+ Often corporate slaves can be hired and fired. 

They can be held from the time they sign a contract, and deprived of the right:

+ to think by themselves, 
+ to refuse to follow instructions, 
+ or to demand explanation.

A slave is a person who is the property of and wholly subject to another. When someone in a company has no choice and is unable to make decision, they become corporate slaves.

## Time to free our souls

Abolishing corporate slavery doesn't meant the end of companies and organizations. On the contrary, they are changing to be the medium for this freedom. There are already examples of organizations that have been "freed". These organizations promote self-management and self-organizing principles. 

But freedom can be daunting. People may not be ready for it and may not event want it. 

Organizations will have to accompany their people in this newly learned freedom.  Learning to decide with your consciousness by yourself is unknown territory for many. Because many of us are trained to be corporate slaves: our education system was build to serve organizations that are seen as machines. Students graduate ready to be replaceable parts for machines that are perfectly monitored and controlled. 

Organizations and society as a whole, especially our education system, will have to change to:

+ allow people to find their calling
+ operate on new models that will let people express their calling in a fair way

In organizations we already see the emergence of [evolutionary-teal organizations](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/). In economy, we already see [new power](https://hbr.org/2014/12/understanding-new-power) business models. In society, we still have to build a [collaborative society](http://magazine.ouishare.net/2014/11/the-power-of-side-effects-towards-a-collaborative-society/).
