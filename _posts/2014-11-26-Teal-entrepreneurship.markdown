Teal entrepreneurship is the search of new business models that embrace the paradigm of evolutionary-teal organizations and the paradigm of new power.

The 2 paradigms go together hand in hand: they both address the key question of engaging with people. The evolutionary-teal paradigm provides an internal approach as to how to keep individuals engaged in organizations. The new power paradigm provides an external approach as to how to keep customers engaged with a business.

Interestingly, the proposition in each paradigm tend to blur the line between internal and external, and so both paradigms meet beautifully in common "being values" that reinforce human capital.
In a world where machines and computers are taking over most of what we humans do, we achieve more humanity with more meaning and consciousness, both at the individual and collective levels.

## Evolutionary-teal paradigm

The paradigm is introduced by Frederic Laloux in Reinventing Organizations. Teal is the latest stage in the color scheme describing the historical development stages of human organization. 
Each color of development is enabled by different cognitive, psychological or moral breakthroughs. They together bring up a new level of understanding of what being human means, or in other words, a new level of consciousness.

Every stage includes and transcends the previous. There are no better stage than another, each stage is more adapted to certain contexts. Individuals operate from different stages and usually access a later stage when they hit challenges that can't be resolved from the current stage they are in. In today's social and economic context, opening to the evolutionary-teal paradigm is extremely relevant.

Engagement in the evolutionary-teal paradigm will tap into people's aspiration for wholeness, purpose and self-management.

## New power paradigm

The new power paradigm is described by Jeremy Heimans, and explains how the dynamics of change have shifted from closed currency (old power) to participative current (new power).

Engagement in the new power paradigm will tap into people's growing capacity and desire to participate, from sharing and shaping to funding, producing and co-owning. 

The new power is what drives businesses like facebook, airbnb, kickstarter, wikipedia, etc.

## Common "Being values"

In both paradigms, we see the emergence of a new set of values and beliefs. 

First of all about people: it is as if we had suddenly woken up and realized that we couldn't deal with people the way we do with inanimate resources or users without a face. 

+ People can learn, they have a will of their own, they have their soul and their talent. They are each unique and the experience they live and share is unique.
+ People are of equal value. They have a richness that can't be simply summarized in a job title or as a belonging to an organization. They sometimes fight internal battles that others can't judge.

Then about what is valuable to people: trust and meaning, which are at the core of any community building. 

Collaboration, collective intelligence, transparency, advice process, self-management, self-organizations, etc. are all the result of this new set of values and beliefs.
