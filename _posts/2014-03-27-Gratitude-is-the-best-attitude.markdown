*"God gave you a gift of 86,400 seconds today.  
Have you used one to say "thank you?"*  
 - William A. Ward

At work, recognition is important. Yet gratitude is even more.

Whereas one is given recognition for something that has been achieved, gratitude can be expressed before any achievement and even in case of failures. We don't have to lie and say "great job" for something that isn't up to the expectations, but we can always say "thank you" for the efforts. Yet let's not only express gratitude in order to express disappointment. 

Gratitude is understanding there's a long way ahead.<br/>
Gratitude is willingness to share that journey.

Gratitude isn't for the help one gets from others.<br/>
Gratitude is for the beauty one sees in them.

Gratitude is not about being fair and paying the right compensation to make others happy.<br/>
Gratitude is not indebtedness and being able to look yourself in the mirror, proving that you haven't been cheating on them.

Gratitude is realizing that people's work is not a given, even if they are paid for it.<br/>
Gratitude is  acknowledging  that people are free to make their own choices, even if one can influence them.

I found it very sad that most "thank you" are only said when people leave their job or are about to.<br/>
I wish I'd hear more "thank you" around me. I hope to say "thank you" often enough to people I work with.
