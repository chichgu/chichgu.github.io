*“You must be the change you wish to see in the world”*
- Mahatma Gandhi

I left my job at Officience quite in a rush, to sort out my personal life: I didn't realize how much pressure I put on myself and how much some conflicts had affected me.

I left with a mixed feeling of relief and fear. Relief to understand what the real problem was and let go. Fear to fail and waste all the efforts that were put in something I really believed in.

When I left, I was working on this note, but I didn't get the chance to post it. Here it is, and hopefully it will stick as my legacy after 6 months interim as "CEO".

This dream is not only what I wish for Officience, but for any company.

I have a dream. A dream that one day all Offies will be proud to be Offies, not because Officience is famous, but because they know why they are Offies.

Not only for the causes we promote and the values we carry, but for they have an ideal that they know they can fulfill in Officience. For they are safe to try and fail and succeed, for they will have the recognition and gratitude for what they do.

For they are not scared to learn and work hard, because they work for nobody but themselves yet with others to achieve what together they truly want for themselves, the customers, the organization, its ecosystem, the world.
